     <h1>Survey Paper: AI/ML Dataflow Graph Scheduling</h1>
     <p>The execution of AI/ML models heavily relies on efficient <strong>dataflow graph scheduling</strong>, where computational tasks are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These graphs dictate the execution order of operations, making <strong>optimal scheduling crucial</strong> for improving computational efficiency, reducing latency, and maximizing resource utilization.</p>
 
     <h2>Key Areas of Investigation</h2>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Algorithmic Techniques:</strong> Investigating scheduling algorithms such as list scheduling, priority-based heuristics, critical path methods, and task graph partitioning.</li>
         <li><strong>High-Performance Computing (HPC) Considerations:</strong> Exploring parallel computing strategies for GPUs, TPUs, and multi-core architectures, along with memory-aware optimizations.</li>
         <li><strong>ML-Based Scheduling Approaches:</strong> Examining reinforcement learning and neural network-driven auto-scheduling techniques in frameworks like TensorFlow XLA, Apache TVM, and PyTorch TorchScript.</li>
     </ul>
 
     <p>This survey will provide a comparative analysis of scheduling strategies, highlight existing challenges, and identify future research directions for improving scheduling efficiency in AI/ML workflows.</p>
