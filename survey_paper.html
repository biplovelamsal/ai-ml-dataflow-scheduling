    <h1>Implementation Based Paper: Parallel and Distributed Deep Learning Techniques for Real-Time Object Detection
</h1>
<p>Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, enabling systems to identify and localize objects within images. It plays a key role in applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, robotics, and smart city infrastructure. However, training modern object detection models like YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN is computationally expensive due to their deep architectures and large-scale datasets. This project aims to investigate and evaluate the efficiency of parallel and distributed training methods to accelerate the training process of object detection models without sacrificing performance.</p>
    <h2>Key Areas of Investigation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Techniques:</strong> Investigating scheduling algorithms such as list scheduling, priority-based heuristics, critical path methods, and task graph partitioning.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Performance Computing (HPC) Considerations:</strong> Exploring parallel computing strategies for GPUs, TPUs, and multi-core architectures, along with memory-aware optimizations.</li>
        <li><strong>ML-Based Scheduling Approaches:</strong> Examining reinforcement learning and neural network-driven auto-scheduling techniques in frameworks like TensorFlow XLA, Apache TVM, and PyTorch TorchScript.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This survey will provide a comparative analysis of scheduling strategies, highlight existing challenges, and identify future research directions for improving scheduling efficiency in AI/ML workflows.</p>
